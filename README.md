# iClicker Remote [Base Station](https://www.iclicker.com/instructors/hardware/base) Implementation Using the [ADALM-PLUTO](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm-pluto.html)

This project is a reverse engineered implementation of an iClicker remote base station. So far it is only able to recieve.

This project uses [SoapySDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR) for generic SDR support, but it has only been tested with the [ADALM-PLUTO](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/adalm-pluto.html).

Probably not in a working state right now.
